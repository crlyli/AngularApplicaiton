# AngularApplicaiton
(Will finish updating as I continue to work on this project for educational purposes.)
Angular and ASP .NET Core project
Project framework is .NET 8.0
This project uses MySQL and MySQL Workbench to manage database. 

The first purpose of this project was to gain greater knowledge on how to set up a ASP .NET Core project with Angular. As well as using the Repository Design Pattern to set up the database connections.
The second purpose of this project was to gain a better understanding of how send data to and from the database from the Angular front end through the use of services. 
Database project (Repository Pattern) is a class library containing three repositories
Book Data repository including author, title and description of a book
Reader Data repository containing a user full name
